+ What's it?
A free, basic open source tool that allows you to get extra FOV and tickets for the free multiplayer game "PROJECT: PLAYTIME".

+ How does it work?
It accesses the game's save files in local AppData, and replaces them with modded ones downloaded from our server, you can actually do this by yourself by downloading the files I'll link with the tool, though the tool should ease the work by a chunk of time, specially if you want to quickly revert your changes.
